### ‚ú® Overview

The **Encrypted File Vault** is a robust, full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application designed for highly secure personal or organizational file management. It prioritizes data privacy and integrity by implementing advanced cryptographic techniques and comprehensive security measures.

**Key Highlight:** This project demonstrates a deep understanding of full-stack development, modern frontend frameworks (React with Shadcn UI/TailwindCSS), and, most importantly, **critical backend security practices and cryptographic implementations** crucial for protecting sensitive user data.

### üåü Core Features & Technologies

#### Frontend Experience (React, Vite, Shadcn UI, TailwindCSS)
* **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop Uploads:** Seamless file uploads with smooth animations and clear progress indicators.
* **Dynamic File Management Dashboard:** Modern grid/list view toggle for easy navigation and management of encrypted files.
* **Interactive Progress Bars:** Real-time upload/download progress with fluid animations.
* **Secure Authentication Interfaces:** Dedicated interfaces for 2FA setup (QR code generation) and Email OTP verification.
* **Safe File Preview:** In-browser preview capabilities for secure file types (e.g., images, PDFs) after decryption.
* **Elegant Modals:** Smooth modal animations for all file operations (delete, share, preview).

#### Backend Security (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)
* **File Encryption (AES-256-GCM):** Industry-standard symmetric encryption for all uploaded files.
    * **Why AES-256-GCM?** Chosen for its robust encryption (256-bit key length) combined with **Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)**. GCM mode provides crucial **integrity checking** and **authenticity verification** via an authentication tag, preventing sophisticated tampering attacks.
* **Unique Encryption Keys per User:** Each user's files are encrypted with keys derived uniquely for them, enhancing isolation.
* **2FA Implementation (TOTP with `speakeasy`):** Time-based One-Time Passwords for an extra layer of login security.
* **Email OTP Verification (`nodemailer`):** Secondary verification via email for critical actions or login.
* **Secure File Storage:** Encrypted files stored in a non-web-accessible directory with unique, unguessable filenames (UUIDs).
* **Metadata Encryption:** Sensitive file metadata (IVs, Auth Tags, checksums) are securely stored alongside the encrypted content.
* **File Integrity Verification:** Checksums (SHA256) are generated on original files and verified upon download to detect any unauthorized modifications.
* **Secure Key Derivation (PBKDF2):** Passwords are never stored directly; strong, user-specific encryption keys are derived using PBKDF2, resisting brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

#### Comprehensive Security Implementations
* **Client-Side File Type Validation:** Initial validation for common file types.
* **Server-Side File Scanning (Conceptual):** Architecture supports integration with external virus scanning services.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevents brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints and abuse of upload/download features.
* **User Activity Logging:** Detailed audit trail for significant user actions (logins, uploads, downloads, shares).
* **Session Timeout Management:** JWT-based session management with configurable expiry.
* **Password Strength Enforcement:** Ensures users create strong, complex passwords during registration.

#### Advanced Capabilities
* **File Sharing with Temporary Links:** Securely share files via time-limited, one-time-use links.
* **Audit Trail for File Access:** Comprehensive logging provides visibility into all file operations.
* **File Versioning:** Maintain encrypted historical versions of files.
* **Recovery Key Generation (Conceptual):** Supports the creation of recovery keys for account access.

### üíª Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Encrypted File Vault locally.

**Prerequisites:**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Community Server or a MongoDB Atlas Free Tier account)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**1. Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Git-brintsi20/1.CyberProj_Mern_Auth_Sys.git](https://github.com/Git-brintsi20/1.CyberProj_Mern_Auth_Sys.git)
   cd EncryptedFileVault

```

**2. Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    # .env in server/
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/filevault # Or your MongoDB Atlas URI
    JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPER_STRONG_AND_RANDOM_JWT_SECRET_KEY
    FILE_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=ANOTHER_VERY_LONG_AND_RANDOM_KEY_FOR_FILES
    EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
    EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password_or_app_specific_password # Use app password for Gmail
    EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail # e.g., 'gmail', 'outlook', 'sendgrid'
    ```
    **Remember to never commit your `.env` file to Git!**

    Run the backend:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server should start on `http://localhost:5000`.

**3. Frontend Setup:**
    Open a new terminal and navigate to the `client/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    Run the frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend application should open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default).
    You can now interact with the Encrypted File Vault!

### üîÆ Future Enhancements

* **Public Key Cryptography for Sharing:** Implement asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA) for secure key exchange when sharing files, allowing recipients to decrypt with their private keys.
* **Client-Side Encryption:** Explore options for encrypting files directly in the browser before upload, minimizing plaintext exposure on the server (though more complex for key management).
* **Integration with Cloud Storage:** Allow users to connect to their own cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage) as a backend for encrypted files.
* **Real-time Notifications:** Implement WebSockets for real-time notifications on file uploads, shares, or access.
* **Advanced Analytics & Reporting:** More detailed dashboards for usage patterns, security events, etc.
* **Mobile App Companion:** Develop a native mobile application.
